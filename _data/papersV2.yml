  TITLE: Recurring Verification of Interaction Authenticity Within Bluetooth Networks
  abstract: 'Although user authentication has been well explored, device-to-device
    authentication  &mdash; specifically in Bluetooth networks  &mdash; has not seen
    the same attention. We propose Verification of Interaction Authenticity (VIA)  &mdash;
    a recurring authentication scheme based on evaluating characteristics of the communications
    (interactions) between devices. We adapt techniques from wireless traffic analysis
    and intrusion-detection systems to develop behavioral models that capture typical,
    authentic device interactions (behavior); these models enable recurring verification
    of device behavior. To evaluate our approach we produced a new dataset consisting
    of more than 300 Bluetooth network traces collected from 20 Bluetooth-enabled
    smart-health and smart-home devices. In our evaluation, we found that devices
    can be correctly verified at a variety of granularities, achieving an F1-score
    of 0.86 or better in most cases. '

  TITLE: 'Poster: Analyzing Application-Layer Security in Bluetooth Devices: Auditing
    for Encryption'
  abstract: ' Bluetooth is a wireless technology used in a variety of settings, including
    home, work, transportation, and healthcare. If Bluetooth devices are not properly
    secured, there can be significant harm to users. Data encryption is a widely accepted
    security control that protects against many weaknesses in data transmission and
    communication between all types of devices (wired, wireless, Bluetooth, etc.).
    Although the Bluetooth protocol establishes encryption standards for packet transmission
    "over the air", devices are vulnerable to attacks that steal or manipulate data
    within a device if they lack internal security. This research aims to develop
    and implement a technique that automatically detects whether connected Bluetooth
    devices are using application-layer encryption. '

  TITLE: Trustworthy Wireless Personal Area Networks
  abstract: " In the Internet of Things (IoT), everyday objects are equipped with\
    \ the ability to compute and communicate. These smart things have invaded the\
    \ lives of everyday people, being constantly carried or worn on our bodies, and\
    \ entering into our homes, our healthcare, and beyond. This has given rise to\
    \ wireless networks of smart, connected, always-on, personal things that are constantly\
    \ around us, and have unfettered access to our most personal data as well as all\
    \ of the other devices that we own and encounter throughout our day. It should,\
    \ therefore, come as no surprise that our personal devices and data are frequent\
    \ targets of ever-present threats. Securing these devices and networks, however,\
    \ is challenging. In this dissertation, we outline three critical problems in\
    \ the context of Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) and present our solutions\
    \ to these problems.  <br/><br/> First, I present our Trusted I/O solution (BASTION-SGX)\
    \ for protecting sensitive user data transferred between wirelessly connected\
    \ (Bluetooth) devices. This work shows how in-transit data can be protected from\
    \ privileged threats, such as a compromised OS, on commodity systems. I present\
    \ insights into the Bluetooth architecture, Intel\u2019s Software Guard Extensions\
    \ (SGX), and how a Trusted I/O solution can be engineered on commodity devices\
    \ equipped with SGX.  <br/><br/> Second, I present our work on AMULET and how\
    \ we successfully built a wearable health hub that can run multiple health applications,\
    \ provide strong security properties, and operate on a single charge for weeks\
    \ or even months at a time. I present the design and evaluation of our highly\
    \ efficient event-driven programming model, the design of our low-power operating\
    \ system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile\
    \ time.  <br/><br/> Third, I present a new approach (VIA) that helps devices at\
    \ the center of WPANs (e.g., smartphones) to verify the authenticity of interactions\
    \ with other devices. This work builds on past work in anomaly detection techniques\
    \ and shows how these techniques can be applied to Bluetooth network traffic.\
    \ Specifically, we show how to create normality models based on fine- and course-grained\
    \ insights from network traffic, which can be used to verify the authenticity\
    \ of future interactions. "

  TITLE: Proximity Detection with Single-Antenna IoT Devices
  abstract: Providing secure communications between wireless devices that encounter
    each other on an ad-hoc basis is a challenge that has not yet been fully addressed.
    In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared
    a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity
    are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries.
    Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device
    is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating
    with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna
    devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a
    single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot
    take advantage of these techniques. <br/><br/> We present theoretical and practical
    evaluation of a method called SNAP  &mdash; SiNgle Antenna Proximity  &mdash;
    that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with
    another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating
    nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna's
    near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely
    declares proximity at ranges longer than 14cm.

  TITLE: 'CloseTalker: secure, short-range ad hoc wireless communication'
  abstract: Secure communication is difficult to arrange between devices that have
    not previously shared a secret. Previous solutions to the problem are susceptible
    to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware for out-of-band communication,
    or require an extensive public-key infrastructure. Furthermore, as the number
    of wireless devices explodes with the advent of the Internet of Things, it will
    be impractical to manually configure each device to communicate with its neighbors
    or with the local WLAN. <br/><br/> Our system, CloseTalker, allows simple, secure,
    ad hoc communication between devices in close physical proximity, while jamming
    the signal so it is unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters
    away. CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in the
    devices, does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries, occurs
    only when intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of data or an address
    and key that can be used to establish long-term or long-range communications at
    full bandwidth. <br/><br/> In this paper we present a theoretical and practical
    evaluation of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennas and the fundamental
    physics of radio to establish secure communication between devices that have never
    previously met. We demonstrate that CloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band
    communication between devices in close physical proximity (about 5cm), even though
    they have never met nor shared a key.

  TITLE: 'BASTION-SGX: Bluetooth and Architectural Support for Trusted I/O on SGX'
  abstract: This paper presents work towards realizing architectural support for Bluetooth
    Trusted I/O on SGX-enabled platforms, with the goal of providing I/O data protection
    that does not rely on system software security. Indeed, we are primarily concerned
    with protecting I/O from all software adversaries, including privileged software.
    In this paper we describe the challenges in designing and implementing Trusted
    I/O at the architectural level for Bluetooth. We propose solutions to these challenges.
    In addition, we describe our proof-of-concept work that extends existing over-the-air
    Bluetooth security all the way to an SGX enclave by securing user data between
    the Bluetooth Controller and an SGX enclave.

  TITLE: Challenges to ensuring human safety throughout the life-cycle of Smart Environments
  abstract: The homes, offices, and vehicles of tomorrow will be embedded with numerous
    ``Smart Things,'' networked with each other and with the Internet. Many of these
    Things are embedded in the physical infrastructure, and like the infrastructure
    they are designed to last for decades  &mdash; far longer than is normal with
    today's electronic devices. What happens then, when an occupant moves out or transfers
    ownership of her Smart Environment? This paper outlines the critical challenges
    required for the safe long-term operation of Smart Environments. How does an occupant
    identify and decommission all the Things in an environment before she moves out?
    How does a new occupant discover, identify, validate, and configure all the Things
    in the environment he adopts? When a person moves from smart home to smart office
    to smart hotel, how is a new environment vetted for safety and security, how are
    personal settings migrated, and how are they securely deleted on departure? When
    the original vendor of a Thing (or the service behind it) disappears, how can
    that Thing (and its data, and its configuration) be transferred to a new service
    provider? What interface can enable lay people to manage these complex challenges,
    and be assured of their privacy, security, and safety? We present a list of key
    research questions to address these important challenges.

  TITLE: A Survey of Trustworthy Computing on Mobile  & Wearable Systems
  abstract: Mobile and wearable systems have generated unprecedented interest in recent
    years, particularly in the domain of mobile health (mHealth) where carried or
    worn devices are used to collect health-related information about the observed
    person. Much of the information &mdash; whether physiological, behavioral, or
    social &mdash; collected by mHealth systems is sensitive and highly personal;
    it follows that mHealth systems should, at the very least, be deployed with mechanisms
    suitable for ensuring confidentiality of the data it collects. Additional properties
    &mdash; such as integrity of the data, source authentication of data, and data
    freshness &mdash; are also desirable to address other security, privacy, and safety
    issues. Developing systems that are robust against capable adversaries (including
    physical attacks) is, and has been, an active area of research. While techniques
    for protecting systems that handle sensitive data are well-known today, many of
    the solutions in use today are not well suited for mobile and wearable systems,
    which are typically limited with respect to power, memory, computation, and other
    capabilities. In this paper we look at prior research on developing trustworthy
    mobile and wearable systems. To survey this topic we begin by discussing solutions
    for securing computing systems that are not subject to the type of strict constraints
    associated with mobile and wearable systems. Next, we present other efforts to
    design and implement trustworthy mobile and wearable systems. We end with a discussion
    of future directions.

  TITLE: 'Amulet: An Energy-Efficient, Multi-Application Wearable Platform'
  abstract: Wearable technology enables a range of exciting new applications in health,
    commerce, and beyond. For many important applications, wearables must have battery
    life measured in weeks or months, not hours and days as in most current devices.
    Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long battery life but with the flexibility
    and security to support multiple applications. To achieve long battery life with
    a workload comprising apps from multiple developers, these platforms must have
    robust mechanisms for app isolation and developer tools for optimizing resource
    usage. <br/><br/> We introduce the Amulet Platform for constrained wearable devices,
    which includes an ultra-low-power hardware architecture and a companion software
    framework, including a highly efficient event-driven programming model, low-power
    operating system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications
    at compile time. We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet
    hardware and software, and show how the framework enables developers to write
    energy-efficient applications. Our prototype has battery lifetime lasting weeks
    or even months, depending on the application, and our interactive resource-profiling
    tool predicts battery lifetime within 6-10 % of the measured lifetime.

  TITLE: 'Amulet: A secure architecture for mHealth applications for low-power wearable
    devices'
  abstract: Interest in using mobile technologies for health-related applications
    (mHealth) has increased. However, none of the available mobile platforms provide
    the essential properties that are needed by these applications. An mHealth platform
    must be (i) secure; (ii) provide high availability; and (iii) allow for the deployment
    of multiple third-party mHealth applications that share access to an individual's
    devices and data. Smartphones may not be able to provide property (ii) because
    there are activities and situations in which an individual may not be able to
    carry them (e.g., while in a contact sport). A low-power wearable device can provide
    higher availability, remaining attached to the user during most activities. Furthermore,
    some mHealth applications require integrating multiple on-body or near-body devices,
    some owned by a single individual, but others shared with multiple individuals.
    In this paper, we propose a secure system architecture for a low-power bracelet
    that can run multiple applications and manage access to shared resources in a
    body-area mHealth network. The wearer can install a personalized mix of third-party
    applications to support the monitoring of multiple medical conditions or wellness
    goals, with strong security safeguards. Our preliminary implementation and evaluation
    supports the hypothesis that our approach allows for the implementation of a resource
    monitor on far less power than would be consumed by a mobile device running Linux
    or Android. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our secure architecture
    would enable applications to run for several weeks on a small wearable device
    without recharging.

  TITLE: An Assessment of Single-Channel EMG Sensing for Gestural Input
  abstract: Wearable devices of all kinds are becoming increasingly popular. One problem
    that plagues wearable devices, however, is how to interact with them. In this
    paper we construct a prototype electromyography (EMG) sensing device that captures
    a single channel of EMG sensor data corresponding to user gestures. We also implement
    a machine learning pipeline to recognize gestural input received via our prototype
    sensing device. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of using a BITalino EMG
    sensor to recognize gestural input on a mobile health (mHealth) wearable device
    known as Amulet. We conduct three experiments in which we use the EMG sensor to
    collect gestural input data from (1) the wrist, (2) the forearm, and (3) the bicep.
    Our results show that a single channel EMG sensor located near the wrist may be
    a viable approach to reliably recognizing simple gestures without mistaking them
    for common daily activities such as drinking from a cup, walking, or talking while
    moving your arms.

  TITLE: Computing Along the Big Long River
  abstract: "We develop a model to schedule trips down the Big Long River. The goal\
    \ is to optimally plan boat trips of varying duration and propulsion so as to\
    \ maximize the number of trips over the six-month season. We model the process\
    \ by which groups travel from campsite to campsite. Subject to the given constraints,\
    \ our algorithm outputs the optimal daily schedule for each group on the river.\
    \ By studying the algorithm\u2019s long-term behavior, we can compute a maximum\
    \ number of trips, which we define as the river\u2019s carrying capacity. We apply\
    \ our algorithm to a case study of the Grand Canyon, which has many attributes\
    \ in common with the Big Long River. Finally, we examine the carrying capacity\u2019\
    s sensitivity to changes in the distribution of propulsion methods, distribution\
    \ of trip duration, and the number of campsites on the river."
